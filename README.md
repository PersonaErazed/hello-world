##About me
I am a mathematics and physics undergraduate at Rutgers University in New Jersey, USA. My fiancee and I just finished a 6 month long backpacking trip along the appalachian trail. I am using GitHub to familiarize myself with current populary practices of software versioning. Some of my computer programming training took place at RIT in 2007 where we used an in-house centeralized version control system and learned the importance os standards.

I am working towards creating an web appalication for a service useful to long distance backpackers and similar activities. I have decided to start with learning the spring framework, as I am most comfortable with java and it has introduce itself to me in my past.
